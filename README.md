In this project a parking sensor is constructed on Texas Instruments TM4C123GH6PM board.
It is able to measure a distance up to 1 meter and gives visual output via Nokkia 5110 screen.

Parking sensor system uses the following peripherals:
1.	NOKIA 5110 LCD Screen to display visual output.
2.	1 Potentiometer to adjust the distance at which rotation of motor must stop.
3.	2 Buttons Placed on the TM4C123G Board to be able to switch between states.
4.	HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to measure distance.
5.	Stepper Motor to demonstrate rotational motion.

Deeper explanations on the project is given in ProjectReport.pdf
